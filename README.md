[Harmony](harmony) inspired theme for Hugo static site generator

A running version of this theme could be found in my personal [website](website).

## Note

This is a working-in-progress theme, totally inspired in [harmony](harmony) jekyll theme but with
personal modification and for [hugo](hugo) generator.

I don't suggest you to use this theme since I'm new to [hugo](hugo) and Go templates.
