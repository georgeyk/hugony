[Harmony][1] inspired theme for [Hugo][2] static site generator

A running version of this theme could be found in my personal [website][3].

## Note

This is a working-in-progress theme, totally inspired in [harmony][1] jekyll theme but with
personal modification and for [hugo][2] generator.

I don't suggest you to use this theme since I'm new to [hugo][2] and Go templates.
